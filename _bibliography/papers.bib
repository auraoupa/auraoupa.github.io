abstract = {Abstract Fine-scale motions (<100 km) contribute significantly to the exchanges and dissipation of kinetic energy in the upper ocean. However, knowledge of ocean kinetic energy at fine-scales (in terms of density and transfers) is currently limited due to the lack of sufficient observational data sets at these scales. The sea-surface height measurements of the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) altimeter mission should provide information on kinetic energy exchanges in the upper ocean down to 10–15 km. Numerical ocean models, able to describe ocean dynamics down to ∼10 km, have been developed in anticipation of the SWOT mission. In this study, we use two state-of-the-art, realistic, North Atlantic simulations, with horizontal resolutions ∼1.5 km, to investigate the distribution and exchanges of kinetic energy at fine-scales in the open ocean. Our results show that the distribution of kinetic energy at fine-scales approximately follows the predictions of quasigeostrophic dynamics in summertime but is somewhat consistent with submesoscale fronts-dominated regimes in wintertime. The kinetic energy spectral fluxes are found to exhibit both inverse and forward cascade over the top 1,000 m, with a maximum inverse cascade close to the average energy-containing scale. The forward cascade is confined to the ocean surface and shows a strong seasonality, both in magnitude and range of scales affected. Our analysis further indicates that high-frequency motions (<1 day) play a key role in the forward cascade and that the estimates of the spectral fluxes based on geostrophic velocities fail to capture some quantitative aspects of kinetic energy exchanges across scales.},

abstract = {Abstract Ocean circulation is dominated by turbulent geostrophic eddy fields with typical scales ranging from 10 to 300 km. At mesoscales (>50 km), the size of eddy structures varies regionally following the Rossby radius of deformation. The variability of the scale of smaller eddies is not well known due to the limitations in existing numerical simulations and satellite capability. Nevertheless, it is well established that oceanic flows (<50 km) generally exhibit strong seasonality. In this study, we present a basin-scale analysis of coherent structures down to 10 km in the North Atlantic Ocean using two submesoscale-permitting ocean models, a NEMO-based North Atlantic simulation with a horizontal resolution of 1/60 (NATL60) and an HYCOM-based Atlantic simulation with a horizontal resolution of 1/50 (HYCOM50). We investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the scale of eddy structures with a particular focus on eddies with scales of 10 to 100 km, and examine the impact of the seasonality of submesoscale energy on the seasonality and distribution of coherent structures in the North Atlantic. Our results show an overall good agreement between the two models in terms of surface wave number spectra and seasonal variability. The key findings of the paper are that (i) the mean size of ocean eddies show strong seasonality; (ii) this seasonality is associated with an increased population of submesoscale eddies (10–50 km) in winter; and (iii) the net release of available potential energy associated with mixed layer instability is responsible for the emergence of the increased population of submesoscale eddies in wintertime.},

abstract = {Abstract Geostrophic alongshore velocity data from a glider repetitive section off the coast of Peru (14°S) are used to study the cross-shore structure and temporal variability of the Peru current system during a 5 week period in April–May 2010. Besides providing substantial information on the surface frontal jet associated with the Peru Coastal Current and the surfacing Peru-Chile Undercurrent that flows poleward trapped on the continental shelf and slope, the glider data reveal the presence of an intense deep equatorward current, which transports up to ∼2.5 Sv. The dynamics of this current are investigated using an eddy-resolving regional model. The variability of the vertically sheared alongshore flow is shown to be related to the passage of a poleward propagating coastal-trapped wave likely of equatorial origin. Solutions from a two-dimensional, linear, coastal wave model suggest that the alongshore current observed vertical structure is associated with the second and third baroclinic modes of the coastal-trapped wave.},

abstract = {The impact of intraseasonal coastal-trapped waves on the nearshore Peru ecosystem is investigated using observations and a regional eddy-resolving physical-ecosystem coupled model. Model results show that intraseasonal variability over the period 2000–2006 represents about one fourth of the total surface chlorophyll variance and one third of the carbon export variance on the Peruvian shelf. Evidence is presented that subsurface nutrient and chlorophyll intraseasonal variability are mainly forced by the coastally trapped waves triggered by intraseasonal equatorial Kelvin waves reaching the South American coast, and propagate poleward along the Peru shore at a speed close to that of high order coastal trapped waves modes. The currents associated with the coastal waves induce an input of nutrients that triggers a subsequent phytoplankton bloom and carbon export. The impact of the local wind-forced intraseasonal variability on the ecosystem is of a similar order of magnitude to that remotely forced in the northern part of the Peru shelf on [50–90] day time scales and dominates over the entire shelf on [20–30] day time scales.}
